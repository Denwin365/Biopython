# Biopython README

This repository contains BioPython code examples which I use in projects.

## Overview

BioPython is a powerful Python library for working with biological data. This repository aims to provide practical examples and demonstrations of its capabilities.

## Contents

* **`sequences/`**: Contains scripts for sequence manipulation (e.g., translation, transcription, reverse complement).
* **`alignments/`**: Includes code for sequence alignment using BioPython's alignment tools.
* **`pdb/`**: Demonstrates how to work with Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, including parsing and structure analysis.
* **`entrez/`**: Shows examples of querying NCBI's Entrez database for biological information.
* **`genbank/`**: Contains scripts for parsing and working with GenBank files.
* **`phylogeny/`**: Code related to phylogenetic analysis and tree construction.
* **`examples/`**: General examples of BioPython usage.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python packages required to run the code.
* And much more.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

* VS Studio code or any other coding software
* Python 3.x

* (Potentially) other required libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`

You can install the required packages using pip:
or just use Google CoLab, just like me ;)
